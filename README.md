# Othello
Fully-playable application for the classic board game Reversi


This was part of a python programming course I took during my freshman year of college.
As a result, a lot of the code is messier than I would like as I was still learning the ropes with python.
Nevertheless, the game itself works perfectly fine.  Just clone the repo and execute the othello_gui.py script with python 3.4.
